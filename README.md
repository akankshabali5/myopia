Abstract:
Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a Deep Learning model for the automated detection and segmentation of pathological myopia (PM) from fundus images. The primary research question addressed is whether the proposed Hybrid Dense-ED-UHI model can accurately identify PM lesions, thereby aiding in early diagnosis and intervention to prevent irreversible vision loss.
Methods: A Hybrid Dense-ED-UHI model, combining DenseNet, Encoder-Decoder architecture, and Hybrid Inception modules, was proposed for PM detection and segmentation. The model was trained and validated using the PALM dataset, comprising fundus images with annotated PM lesions. Training utilized a 15-fold cross-validation approach to ensure robustness. Evaluation metrics including dice score, accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were employed to assess model performance.
Results: The proposed model achieved promising results in PM segmentation, with a dice score of 95.4%, accuracy of 99.9%, AUC of 99.9%, sensitivity of 99.2%, and specificity of 99.9%. These metrics indicate high accuracy and reliability in identifying PM lesions from fundus images, surpassing traditional manual methods and exhibiting superior performance compared to existing automated approaches.
Conclusions: The study demonstrates the efficacy of the Hybrid Dense-ED-UHI model for automated detection and segmentation of pathological myopia. By leveraging Deep Learning techniques, the model offers a reliable and efficient solution for early identification of PM, potentially mitigating the risk of irreversible vision loss. The findings underscore the importance of leveraging advanced computational methods in ophthalmology to improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical outcomes for vision-threatening conditions like PM.
